1. Check if container restart is working as supposed to
2. Handle correctly users and permissions (www-data, nginx, trobin)
   --> especially for folders under /run directory !!
3. Remove packages used only for debugging such as:
    - (?) curl
    - (?) lsof
    - net-tools
    - tree
    - vim
   --> will reduce the size of the image
   --> will enhance containers security by reducing the number of vectors of attack
4. (?) On host, set owner for docker volumes (systemd-resolve:systemd-journal by default)
5. (?) Add `--log-bin=mysqld-bin` to mariadb ENTRYPOINT
6. (?) dockerignore
7. Allow remote connexions to specific compose service address (instead of 0.0.0.0.:*)
   --> cf. `netstat -tuplen`, field `Foreign Address`
8. `service_healty` instead of `service_started`
   --> cf. lemp link into `README.md` for how to use healthcheck
