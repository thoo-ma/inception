BEFORE DEBUG FORKING
___________________
1. Change wordpress admin username and password
2. Handle correctly users and permissions (www-data, nginx, trobin) + chmod
3. Check if container restart is working as supposed to
4. Wordpress Dockerfile: gather all apt installations into one RUN command
   --> except `wget` and `lsb_release`
5. (?) Add `--log-bin=mysqld-bin` to mariadb ENTRYPOINT
6. (?) dockerignore
7. (?) Add `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=inception` into `.env`
   --> or add top-level `name: "inception"` into `docker-compose.yml`


AFTER DEBUG FORKING
___________________
1. Remove packages used only for debugging such as:
    - (?) curl
    - (?) lsof
    - net-tools
    - tree
    - vim
   --> will reduce the size of the image
   --> will enhance containers security by reducing the number of vectors of attack
2. (?) On host, set owner for docker volumes (systemd-resolve:systemd-journal by default)
3. Allow remote connexions to specific compose service address (instead of 0.0.0.0.:*)
   --> cf. `netstat -tuplen`, field `Foreign Address`
4. cf. readme lemp link for the use of healthcheck
