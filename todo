1. nginx service: /var/www/inception is owned by user 1000, which doesn't exist (nor by www-data)
2. mariadb volume is owned by systemd-resolve:systemd-journal -- why not by $USER ?
3. Remove packages used only for debugging such as:
    - (?) curl
    - (?) lsof
    - net-tools
    - tree
    - vim
   --> will reduce the size of the image
   --> will enhance containers security by reducing the number of vectors of attack
4. (?) Add `--log-bin=mysqld-bin` to mariadb ENTRYPOINT
5. (?) dockerignore
6. Allow remote connexions to specific compose service address (instead of 0.0.0.0.:*)
   --> cf. `netstat -tuplen`, field `Foreign Address`
7. into compose file: `service_completed_successfully` doesn't work.
   --> would be better than `service_started` though
