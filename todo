0. rename wordpress `configure.sh` to `entrypoint.sh`
1. Gather RUN commands together when possible to avoid intermediate build images proliferation
2. Change wordpress admin username and password
3. Rename `conf/` to `tools/` when appropriate
4. Handle correctly users and permissions (www-data, nginx, trobin)
5. Check if container restart is working as supposed to
6. (?) Add `--log-bin=mysqld-bin` to mariadb ENTRYPOINT
7. (?) On host, set owner for docker volumes (systemd-resolve:systemd-journal by default)
8. (?) When we do `netstat -tuplen` (for instance in mariadb) customise the `Foreign Address` field to point to the container supposed to reach the service (instead of 0.0.0.0.:*)
9. (?) Add `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=inception` into `.env`
   --> or add top-level `name: "inception"` into `docker-compose.yml`
10.(?) Remove packages used only for debugging such as:
       - (?) curl
       - (?) lsof
       - net-tools
       - tree
       - vim
   --> will reduce the size of the image
   --> will enhance containers security by reducing the number of vectors of attack
11. Wordpress Dockerfile: gather all apt installations into one RUN command (expect wget and lsb_release)
12. (?) dockerignore
13. cf readme lemp link for the use of healthcheck
